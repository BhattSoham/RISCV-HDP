# OBSTACLE AWARENESS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES  #

This section will provide all the necessary details to focus on building an anti-theft detection system at home.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW ##

Improving obstacle awareness for people with impairments is critical for increasing their independence and safety when navigating their surroundings. Using an infrared sensor can help identify barriers in real time while delivering information to the user. Integrating these systems into wearable gadgets or mobility aids allows people with impairments to notice and respond to challenges more efficiently, resulting in more freedom and trust in their everyday activities.

## KEY COMPONENTS ##

**1. IR SENSOR DETECTOR:** The project consists of an IR sensor, which will detect if there are any nearby obstacles for the impaired individuals.

**2. RISC-V PROCESSOR:** The processor that will handle all the necessary instructions customized for designing this project.

**3. BUZZER:** The buzzer will help to detect with its controllable 'On' and 'OFF' switches to detect the access.

**4. RESET:** The "Reset" button will be turned on when the operation will happen.

**5. BATTERY:** There will be a battery that should be charged by the user for the device's operation.
