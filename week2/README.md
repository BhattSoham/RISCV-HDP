# RISC-V BASED MYTH WORKSHOP, BASIC RISC-V MICROARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION and MEASUREMENT OF THE CPU PERFORMANCE #

This section will hold 5 different directories: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Task 4, and Task 5 respectively.

## RISC-V-based MYTH Workshop ##

**TASK 1**

This section is a part of a workshop "RISC-V based MYTH" conducted by VLSI System Design. This section will cover all the basics required related to RISC-V ISA. This section will cover the introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain, with a. Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords, b. Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain, and c. Spike Simulation and Debug.

**TASK 2**

This section is also a part of a workshop "RISC-V based MYTH" conducted by VLSI System Design. This section will cover the introduction to ABI and basic verification flow, with a. Application Binary Interface (ABI), b. Labwork using ABI function calls, and c. Basic verification flow using Iverilog.

The RISC-V GNU Software toolchain can be downloaded from here: [https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain] 

All the instructions used for RISC-V architecture can be accessed by Green cards provided above.

**TASK 3**

This section will cover all the CPU performance metrics associated with understanding RISC-V architecture, along with examples.

**TASK 4**

This section will cover the basic RISC-V Microarchitecture Implementation.

**Task 5**

This section will cover the assignment or task 3 associated with verifying all the previous C codes in Week 1 and Week 2 directories using Risc-V compiler and Spike output. This section also covers the the CPU performance calculation of the assembly codes with those C programs.
