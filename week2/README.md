# RISC-V based MYTH Workshop #

This is part of a workshop "RISC-V based MYTH" conducted by VLSI System Design.

This section will cover all the basics required related to RISC-V ISA. 

The following are as follows:

**RV Day 1**

***1. Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain:***
   
  a. Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords.
  
  b. Labwork for RISC-V software toolchain.

**RV Day 2**  

***2. Introduction to ABI and basic verification flow:***
   
  a. Application Binary Interface (ABI).
  
  b. Labwork using ABI function calls.

  c. Basic verification flow using Iverilog.

The RISC-V GNU Software toolchain can be downloaded from here: [https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain] 

All the instructions used for RISC-V architecture can be accessed by [week2/RISCVGreenCardv8-20151013.pdf] and [week2/riscv-card.pdf]

All the detailed explanations are given in Task1 and Task2 directories.
