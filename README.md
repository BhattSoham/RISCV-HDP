# RISCV-HARDWARE DESIGN PROGRAM (https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/hdp_riscv/)
**Product-Based RISC-V Skilling Program**
1. Exploring RISC-V's history, architecture, and Verilog simulations.
2. Unlocking processor functionalities with hands-on exercises.
3. Delving into Verilog code analysis and advanced instructions.
4. Mastering I/Os with practical, real-world implementations.
5. Enhancing programming with C code and inline assembly.
6. Learning testbench strategies and functional simulation techniques.

## Course Curriculum: ##

The weekly course curriculum includes the following:

### Week 0: ###
1. Computer set up by installing Oracle Virtual VM Machine using VDI.
2. Make a GitHub repository to share your work with others. 

### Week 1: ###
1. Running C codes for *hello world*, *counters*, and *matrix multiplication* with Assembly differences.
2. Work on Binary Arithmetic.
3. Design an *adder* with C and Verilog Code, using Iverilog and gtkwave. Run the same program on Godbolt to generate the assembly instructions.
4. Design a 4-bit *arithmetic logic unit (ALU)* with C and Verilog Code, using Iverilog and gtkwave. Run the same program on Godbolt to generate the assembly instructions.

Other weeks will be posted shortly!
