# RISCV-HARDWARE DESIGN PROGRAM (https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/hdp_riscv/)
**Product-Based RISC-V Skilling Program**
1. Exploring RISC-V's history, architecture, and Verilog simulations.
2. Unlocking processor functionalities with hands-on exercises.
3. Delving into Verilog code analysis and advanced instructions.
4. Mastering I/Os with practical, real-world implementations.
5. Enhancing programming with C code and inline assembly.
6. Learning testbench strategies and functional simulation techniques.

## Course Curriculum: ##

The weekly course curriculum includes the following:

### Week 0: ###
1. Set up the computer by installing Oracle Virtual VM Machine via VDI.
2. Create a GitHub repository so you may share your work with others. 

### Week 1: ###
1. Executing C code for *hello world*, *counters*, and *matrix multiplication* despite Assembly incompatibilities.
2. Focus on binary arithmetic.
3. Create an *adder* with C and Verilog code, utilizing Iverilog and gtkwave. Run the same program on Godbolt to create assembly instructions.
4. Create a 4-bit *arithmetic logic unit (ALU)* with C and Verilog code, utilizing Iverilog and gtkwave. Run the same program on Godbolt to create assembly instructions.

Other weeks will be posted shortly!
