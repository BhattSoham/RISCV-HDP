This course gave participants a comprehensive grasp of creating RISC-V-based embedded projects, covering everything from application code to Netlist. As part of the course curriculum, I got to use the Chipcron tool offered by RISC-V startup https://chipcron-pvt-ltd.github.io/webpage/, to generate a customized RISC-V core. Furthermore, by simulating application code on the created core, I was able to have hands-on experience and improve my understanding of RISC-V architecture and design techniques.
